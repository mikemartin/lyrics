          [00:06.50] Nice to meet you, where you been?
[00:09.00] I could show you incredible things
[00:10.00] Kayaks, yoga and guqin
[00:13.00] Saw you there and I thought
[00:15.00] Oh my god - next new thing
[00:18.00] Is it ‘go’ or is it swing?
[00:20.00] Life’s a game, wanna play?? 
[00:23.00] Ayy

[00:26.00] New country, new degree
[00:28.00] This is great for my narrative
[00:30.00] But some things’ll never change
[00:32.50] Tapioca’s what I need to live 

[00:35.00] Oh hey
[00:36.00] Let’s be friends
[00:37.00] I’m dying to see
[00:38.00] How this one ends
[00:40.00] Grab some ski poles and my hand
[00:43.00] Let’s go to Big White and not die on this ski trip

[00:45.00] So it’s gonna be forever
[00:48.00] Keep each other entertained
[00:51.00] Let’s explore together
[00:53.00] Hike for hours without aim
[00:55.00] Gotta watch the birds nest cameras
[00:58.00] Though some may think it’s lame
[01:00.00] I love the pigeons nesting
[01:03.00] And you love the same
	
[01:05.00] ‘Cause we’re young and we’re restless
[01:07.00] Off to Brazil we go
[01:10.00] Covid travel leaves you breathless
[01:13.00] And stuck in Crooh-zehr-oh 
[01:15.00] Got a list of future travels
[01:17.00] Despite missteps early on 
[01:19.00] I’ve got a free reading week baby
[01:23.00] So won’t you come along (“I can’t”)

[01:29.00] We don’t. Like that. BC. math. 
[01:32.00] It is stupid in every way. 
[01:35.00] I’ll incur advisor’s wrath
[01:37.00] Go against them and they’ll say
[01:39.00] “My god there’s that grad
[01:42.00] She’s not Trotsky, and that’s bad”
[01:45.00] Shift advisors, focus too… On you 

[01:50.00] Wedding dresses, suits, and ties
[01:53.00] Getting hitched is quite a thrill
[01:55.00] Why get married in July?
[01:57.00] February’s so much more chill
[01:59.00] Too bad, bout the rain
[02:02.00] If you’ve come by boat or plane
[02:04.00] Make it sun or Make it snow,
[02:06.00] I can make the bad weather good for a weekend

[02:09.00] ‘Cause we’re young and we’re restless
[02:11.00] Off to Brazil we go
[02:14.00] Covid travel leaves you breathless
[02:17.00] And stuck in Crooh-zehr-oh 
[02:19.00] Got a list of future travels
[02:21.00] Despite missteps early on 
[02:23.00] I’ve got a free reading week baby
[02:27.00] So won’t you come along (“I can’t”)

[02:29.00] So it’s gonna be forever
[02:32.00] Keep each other entertained
[02:34.00] Let’s explore together 
[02:36.00] Hike for hours without aim
[02:39.00] But first we’ll make it official,
[02:41.00] Something to put in a frame
[02:43.00] Paper’s got a blank space baby
[02:47.00] And I’ll write your name
